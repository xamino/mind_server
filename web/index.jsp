<body>
MIND test page for checking the API and as an example for later work on web interfaces.

<br>
JS now enabled, open your console!
<br>
<br>
JS Functions currently available: login(email, password), register(email, password, name), logout(), and send(data).
<br>
<br>
The session is saved in var session for your convenience, no need to copy & paste it. Also note that the JS consists of
three parts: the JQuery library (don't touch!), the library.js (only touch if you're Tamino :P ), and run.js, where all
the functional code should go.
